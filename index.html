			I am a currently a full-time student at Brigham Young University. I graduate this upcoming April 2014 with a Bachelor's of Science degree in Business Management: Marketing.
			</p>
			<p>
			I am an extremely outgoing person who thrives off of a hands-on work experience. I have a wide variety of work experience under my belt, that is listed under the "Resume" tab. I have enjoyed working in various environments through my undergraduate years. Ultimately I would love to create and open up my own dance studio in the Southeast United States or work for a big corporation, like Nike as a brand manager.
			To achieve all of my goals I plan on doing the following:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Graduate from BYU in April with at least a 3.4 GPA</li>
				<li>Travel to different places around the world, to obtain a realistic global perspective of brand management</li>
				<li>Land my first job in the next three months in a creative marketing position, preferably in the sports/athletic industry</li>
			</ul>
